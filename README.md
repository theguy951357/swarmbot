# swarmbot
my swarmbot research project from college. there is an exe file sitting in the releases section to play against it if you have a windows machine. 

It will ask if you would like to play the black or white player. then the bot will play a game of othello with you.

It will show you the board with x's marking the available legal moves you can play. to choose a move, you must choose the first letter of your player color followed by the letter and the number associated with the grid on the board.

B c 4

w d 3

They are not case sensitive.

regular rules of Othello apply.
